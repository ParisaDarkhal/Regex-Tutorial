# RegEx Email Matching Tutorial

The purpose of this tutorial is to explain the RegEx for matching an email, which is:

```regex
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
```

This RegEx consists of several components, such as **anchors**, **quantifiers**, **grouping constructs**, **bracket expressions**, **character classes**, **OR operator**, **flags**, and **character escapes**. Each component has a specific function and meaning in the RegEx which are explained in this [gist](https://github.com/ParisaDarkhal/Regex-Tutorial/blob/main/RegEx-Email-Matching-Tutorial.md).

The tutorial will cover each component in detail and provide examples of how they work and how they can be used to match an email address. The tutorial will also provide some tips and tricks on how to use RegEx effectively and efficiently.

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to understand and apply the RegEx for matching an email to any text that contains email addresses. You will also be able to modify and customize the RegEx according to your needs and preferences.

The tutorial is divided into the following sections:

- Introduction: This section gives an overview of what RegEx is and why it is useful for matching an email address.
- Anchors: This section explains what anchors are and how they specify the position of the match in the string.
- Quantifiers: This section explains what quantifiers are and how they specify how many times a character or a group can be repeated in the match.
- Grouping Constructs: This section explains what grouping constructs are and how they group parts of the RegEx together and capture them as submatches.
- Bracket Expressions: This section explains what bracket expressions are and how they specify a set or a range of characters to match.
- Character Class: This section explains what character class is and how it matches any one of a specified set of characters.
- OR Operator: This section explains what OR operator is and how it matches either one of two alternatives.
- Flags: This section explains what flags are and how they modify the behavior of the RegEx.
- Character Escape: This section explains what character escape is and how it matches a literal character that has a special meaning in RegEx.
