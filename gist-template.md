# RegEx Tuturial for Matching an Email

## Introduction

RegEx, or regular expression, is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern for text. RegEx can be used to check if a string matches a specified pattern, or to extract the parts that match.

## Summary

In this gist, we will explain the RegEx for **matching an email**, which is:
`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

This RegEx consists of several components, such as **anchors, quantifiers, grouping constructs, bracket expressions, character classes, OR operator, flags, and character escapes**. We will explain each of them in detail below.

## Regex Components

### **Anchors**

In general, Anchors are special characters that specify the position of the match in the string. There are two types of anchors: `^` and `$`. The `^` anchor matches the beginning of the string. For example, `^a` matches any string that starts with `a`. The `$` anchor matches the end of the string. For example, `a$` matches any string that ends with `a`.

In our email-matching RegEx, we use both anchors to ensure that the whole string is an email address. The `^` anchor matches the start of the string, and the `$` anchor matches the end of the string. **This means that nothing can precede or follow the email pattern.** For example, this RegEx will match `alice@example.com`, but NOT `hello alice@example.com` or `alice@example.com bye` (because of space).

### **Quantifiers**

Quantifiers are special characters that specify how many times a character or a group of characters can be repeated in the match. There are several types of quantifiers: `*`, `+`, `?`, `{n}`, `{n,m}`, and `{n,}`. Here we explain them individually:

- The `*` quantifier matches **zero or more** times. For example, `a*` matches any string that contains zero or more `a`s.
- The `+` quantifier matches **one or more** times. For example, `a+` matches any string that contains one or more `a`s.
- The `?` quantifier matches **zero or one** time. For example, `a?` matches any string that contains zero or one `a`.
- The `{n}` quantifier matches **exactly n times**. For example, `a{3}` matches any string that contains exactly three `a`s.
- The `{n,m}` quantifier matches **between n and m times**, inclusive. For example, `a{2,4}` matches any string that contains between two and four `a`s.
- The `{n,}` quantifier matches **at least n times**. For example, `a{2,}` matches any string that contains at least two `a`s.

We can see some of these quantifiers in our email-matching RegEx:

- The first part of the email address RegEx is `[a-z0-9_\.-]+` . This means that it can contain **one or more characters** from the range `[a-z]`, `[0-9]`, `_` (underline), `.` (literal dot), or `-` (dash). For example, this part can match `alice`, `bob123`, or `john.doe`. As you see, some of the characters that have specific meaning in RegEx explanation (such as `.` or `-`), become literal when they go inside the brackets.
- The second part of the email address RegEx is `[\da-z\.-]+`. This means that it can contain **one or more characters** from the range [0-9] (because of `\d`), `[a-z]`, `.` (dot), or `-`. For example, this part can match example, `gmail`, or `co.uk`.
- The third part of the email address RegEx is `[a-z\.]{2,6}`. This means that it can contain **between two and six characters** from the range `[a-z]` or `.` (dot). For example, this part can match `.com`, `.org`, or `.co.in`.

### **Grouping Constructs**

Grouping constructs are special characters that group parts of the RegEx together and capture them as submatches. There are two types of grouping constructs: parentheses `( )` and non-capturing parentheses `(?: )`.

- The parentheses `( )` create a capturing group, which means that the part of the string that matches the group can be accessed later by using a backreference `\n`, where n is the number of the group. For example, `(a)\1` matches any string that contains two consecutive `a`s.
- The non-capturing parentheses `(?: )` create a non-capturing group, which means that the part of the string that matches the group is not stored for later use. This is useful for applying quantifiers or alternation to a group without capturing it. For example, `(?:ab)+` matches any string that contains one or more repetitions of ab.

In our email-matching RegEx, we use three capturing groups to separate each part of the email address. The first group is`([a-z0-9_\.-]+)`, which captures the user name part. The second group is `([\da-z\.-]+)`, which captures the domain name part. The third group is `([a-z.]{2,6})`, which captures the top-level domain part. It is interesting that we can use these groups to access each part of the email address later by using backreferences `\1`, `\2`, and `\3`. For example, we can use `\1@\2.\3` to reconstruct the email address from its parts.

### **Bracket Expressions**

Bracket expressions are special characters that specify a set or a range of characters to match. A bracket expression starts with `[` and ends with `]`. Inside the brackets, we can list individual characters or ranges separated by `-`. We can also use a caret `^` at the beginning to negate the set and match any character except those listed.
For example, `[abc]` matches any character from the set `{a,b,c}`. `[a-c]` matches any character from the range `{a,b,c}`. `[abcx-z]` matches any character from the set `{a,b,c,x,y,z}`. `[^abc]` matches any character except those from the set `{a,b,c}`.

In our email-matching RegEx, we use several bracket expressions to specify the allowed characters for each part of the email address.

- The first bracket expression is `[a-z0-9_\.-]`. This means that it can match any character from the range `[a-z]`, `[0-9]`, `_` , `.` , or `-`.
- The second bracket expression is `[\da-z\.-]`. This means that it can match any character from `\d`, which is equivalent to `[0-9]`, `[a-z]`, `.` , or `-`.
- The third bracket expression is `[a-z\.]`. This means that it can match any character from `[a-z]` or `.`

### **Character Classes**

A character class is a special notation that matches any one of a specified set of characters. A character class is enclosed by square brackets `[ ]`. Inside the brackets, we can list individual characters or ranges separated by `-`. We can also use a caret `^` at the beginning to negate the set and match any character except those listed.
For example, `[abc]` matches any character from the set `{a,b,c}`. `[a-c]` matches any character from the range `{a,b,c}`. `[abcx-z]` matches any character from the set `{a,b,c,x,y,z}`. `[^abc]` matches any character except those from the set `{a,b,c}`.
In our email-matching RegEx, we use several character classes to specify the allowed characters for each part of the email address.

- The first character class is `[a-z0-9_\.-]`. This means that it can match any character from the range `[a-z]`, `[0-9]`, `_`, `.` , or `-`.
- The second character class is `[\da-z\.-]`. This means that it can match any character from `\d`, which is equivalent to `[0-9]`, `[a-z]`, `.` , or `-`.
- The third character class is `[a-z\.]`. This means that it can match any character from `[a-z]` or .

### **The OR Operator**

The OR operator is a special character that matches either one of two alternatives. The OR operator is denoted by a vertical bar `|`. The OR operator has the lowest precedence among all RegEx operators, so it is usually used with parentheses `( )` to group the alternatives. For example, `(a|b)` matches either `a` or `b`. `(red|blue|green)` matches either `red`, `blue`, or `green`.

In our email-matching RegEx, we do not use the OR operator explicitly, but we can think of some parts of the RegEx as using it implicitly. For example, the bracket expression `[a-z0-9_\.-]` can be seen as matching either one of the characters inside the brackets. Similarly, the grouping construct `([a-z\.]{2,6})` can be seen as matching either one of the possible top-level domains that have between two and six characters from `[a-z]` or `.` .
